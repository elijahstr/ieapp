                <h3>Description:</h3>
                <p>Founderâ€™s Workshop, in short, is a class that helps students learn the necessary skills to take their ideas and turn them into real life startups.  The class consisted of two primary components: learning about key elements of entrepreneurship, and then incorporating those same elements into a series of pitch presentations.  The presentations were pitches of real startup ideas created by students in the course, and by pitching these ideas students were able to get feedback from peers and the professors on their ideas.</p>

                <h3>Reflection:</h3>
                <p>This course was the perfect gateway course for me because it took my budding interest in entrepreneurship and turned that interest into a passion.  The dual perspectives of Professor McClelland and Professor Rhee allowed us to get multiple insights into the different subjects we examined.  Another excellent feature of the class was the guest speakers and judges that visited our class, as these successful entrepreneurs and their stories have further motivated me to pursue my entrepreneurial goals.  Overall, this class was an amazing gateway course to spark further entrepreneurial enthusiasm within me.</p>
